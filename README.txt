Code was created and tested on bingsuns
To Run: make
	java Gen_pass
	follow prompts and enter some sample users and passwords
	java SslServ <Port>
	java SslCli <Domain> <Port>
	follow prompts

Everything should work as expected. Password file must be named pass.txt.
System properties are set within the code to allow it to work with ssl certificate.
